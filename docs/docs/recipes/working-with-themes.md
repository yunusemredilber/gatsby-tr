A [Gatsby theme](/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes) abstracts Gatsby configuration (shared functionality, data sourcing, design) into an installable package. This means that the configuration and functionality isnâ€™t directly written into your project, but rather versioned, centrally managed, and installed as a dependency. You can seamlessly update a theme, compose themes together, and even swap out one compatible theme for another.

## Creating a new site using a theme starter

Creating a site based on a starter that configures a theme follows the same process as creating a site based on a starter that **doesn't** configure a theme. In this example you can use the [starter for creating a new site that uses the official Gatsby blog theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme).

### Prerequisites

- The [Gatsby CLI](/docs/gatsby-cli) installed

### Directions

1. Generate a new site based on the blog theme starter:

```shell
gatsby new {your-project-name} https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

2. Run your new site:

```shell
cd {your-project-name}
gatsby develop
```

### Additional resources

- Learn how to use an existing Gatsby theme in the [shorter conceptual guide](/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme) or the more detailed [step-by-step tutorial](/tutorial/using-a-theme).
